          <p id="bio-text">Henrietta (Loretta) Pleasant was born August 1, 1920. In her early life she worked as a tobacco farmer in Virginia. She married her Husband David Lacks in 1941 and moved to Maryland. There they were able to purchase a home and continue to grow their family. Henrietta had five children before she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in January, 1951. She had been complaining of a "knot" in her womb and after a severe hemmorhage she was referred to Johns Hopkins. There Dr. Howard W. Jones took a biopsy of the mass for laboratory testing. She was eventually diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and treated with radium tube inserts. During treatment samples of healthy and cancerous tissue were collected without Henrietta's knowlege or consent. The cells from the cancerous sample came to be known as the HeLa immortal cell line, commonly used in contemporary biomedical research. Henrietta Lacks was admitted to the hospital in August after a treatment session due to severe pain and died nearly one month later on October 4, 1951 at the age of 31. Partial autopsy confirmed the cancer had metastasized throughout her entire body. She was buried in her family cemetery in Lackstown, Virginia. </p>

        <p id="med-research-text">Though she succumbed to the disease in 1951, her cells would go on to advance medical research for years to come. HeLa cells are unique beccause they can divide multiple times without dying, which is why they are considered immortal. The ability to rapidly reproduce HeLa cells in a laoraroty setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, HeLa cells have been used to: </p>

          <p id="legacy-text">Henrietta Lacks life was biographed in the book "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks" by Rebecca Skloot in 2010. In 2017 Oprah adapted the book to a film which she starred in and executive produced. The story raises awareness of her remarkable life and outstanding contributions to science. It also highlights the issues around informed-consent and what tissue samples can be used for. Henrietta Lacks's estate sued to get past and future compensation for the alleged unauthoried and widely known sale of HeLa cells by Thermo Fischer Scientific in 2021. They are also seeking payment from 100+ pharmaceutical companies that have used and profitted from HeLa cells.</p>
